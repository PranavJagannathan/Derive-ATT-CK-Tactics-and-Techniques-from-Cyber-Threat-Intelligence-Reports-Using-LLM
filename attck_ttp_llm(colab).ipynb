            " Hey team, just got some reports about a phishing campaign hitting financial orgs and government agencies in APAC. Looks like it started early March, some of the emails weve seen have subjects like Urgent Account Verification Required and Payroll Update  March 2025. The attachments are fake invoices Invoice_March2025.pdf.exe and macroenabled Word docs payment_receipt_2025.docm. If the user enables macros, it executes a PowerShell script update.ps1 which then downloads a secondstage payload from hxxpc2server.xyzsecondstage.bin. Looks like a RAT. Seeing multiple reports of outbound connections to 185.220.101.3 over HTTPS, possibly used as a C2. This IP was previously linked to APT29 activity but not confirmed yet. Also found some new domains registered last monthsecureloginbanking.com, clientupdate.xyz, govdocumentsauth.com. These were all set up within the last 30 days, so likely burner domains. Checking logs from a compromised endpoint, shows user opened the email, launched the attachment, PowerShell fired, and a connection was made to 185.220.101.3. The malware installs persistence through registry keys and scheduled tasks, reexecutes itself every 6 hours. Also noticed DNS tunneling activity, frequent resolution requests for clientupdate.xyz, might be exfiltrating data this way. This campaign looks a lot like previous Cozy Bear APT29 ops, but we need to confirm. The tactics matchspearphishing, macro payloads, PowerShell execution, HTTPS C2. Could be targeting IT admins and finance officers specifically, theyre getting most of the phishing emails. Need more sample hashes to confirm if this matches past APT29 activity. If anyone has seen similar IoCs, let me know. We should probably start blocking those domains and C2 IPs at the firewall. Also, lets get a YARA rule going for the payload. Need to see if this RAT has been used before. Lets check if any other financial orgs are seeing this too, might be bigger than we think.\n"

            "The attack begins with a spear-phishing campaign targeting financial organizations and government agencies in the APAC region, particularly IT administrators and finance officers.  Emails with subjects like \"Urgent Account Verification Required\" or \"Payroll Update March 2025\" contain malicious attachments disguised as invoices (PDF.exe) or macro-enabled Word documents. Upon opening and enabling macros, a PowerShell script (`update.ps1`) is executed, which downloads a second-stage RAT payload from `hxxpc2server.xyz/secondstage.bin`.  The malware establishes persistence through registry keys and scheduled tasks, ensuring re-execution every 6 hours.  Communication with a suspected C2 server (`185.220.101.3`) occurs over HTTPS, and data exfiltration is suspected via DNS tunneling using the domain `clientupdate.xyz`.  The observed TTPs and infrastructure bear resemblance to previous APT29 (Cozy Bear) campaigns, but further analysis is needed for definitive attribution.\n"
